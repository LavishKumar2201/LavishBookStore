I Created my project using visual studio 2019 named LavishBookStore
After creating i ran the project adn it didn't work so i commented out line number 7 under launchsetting.json and 
after that it worked my welcome page appears
After That I created a repostory on my github account and made changes in my startup.cs file in line number 35.
